This program is designed to recover deleted JPEG images from a forensic image of a memory card. It scans the memory card for JPEG signatures, which are specific byte sequences that indicate the beginning of a JPEG file. 
Once a signature is found, the program begins writing the JPEG data to a new file. 
It continues writing until it detects the next JPEG signature or the end of the card. Each recovered file is saved with a unique three-digit name. 
The program assumes the card uses a FAT file system and operates on 512-byte blocks, which simplifies file recovery.
